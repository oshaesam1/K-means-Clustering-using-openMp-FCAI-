# K-means-Clustering-using-openMp-FCAI-
**implement the k means algorithm using the open MP function only:**
- Number of data points is known
- The datapoint are in 2 dimension i.e, each point is represented as (x,y)

- The program output is as follow
Cluster 1:
(x1,y1)
(x2, y2)
Where x is the location of point in x dimension and y is the location of point in y
dimension and cluster is in which cluster this point belongs to.
